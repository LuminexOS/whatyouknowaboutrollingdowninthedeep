  <h1>Exploring the Heart of Taiwan: A Week of Culture and Connection</h1>

  <h2>A Modern Adventure Begins – From Taipei to Taichung</h2>
  <p>Over 8 days, my friends and I explored cities like Taipei, Taichung, and Keelung. I shared a room with Gregorious and James. Though we didn’t do a live-in like in Jogja, we experienced the real daily life of local people — especially students.</p>

  <h2>A Glimpse into Student Life – Sacred Heart School Keelung</h2>
  <p>We joined local classes and activities. Since I speak Chinese fluently, I understood more and felt connected. The differences between our schools were fascinating to observe.</p>

  <h2>Sky-High Wonder – Taipei 101 and Hidden Moments</h2>
  <p>The elevator ride and view from the 89th floor were unforgettable. I briefly talked to local women, but felt awkward and left — still, the moment was special.</p>

  <h2>More Than Just Museums</h2>
  <p>The 921 Earthquake Museum showed human resilience. The Cycling Culture Museum showed how even simple inventions shape society. Nothing felt boring — everything had a story.</p>

  <h2>The Natural Side – Waterfalls, Wetlands, and Lanterns</h2>
  <p>From Shihfen Waterfall to Gaomei’s sunsets, Taiwan’s nature stunned me. Jiufen’s narrow streets, street food, and colorful lanterns left lasting impressions — captured beautifully on my ROG 8 phone.</p>

  <h2>Kindness Across Borders</h2>
  <p>Even without a live-in, I felt the warmth of Taiwan’s people — students, shopkeepers, strangers. They showed me that happiness comes from community, not just technology.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This edutrip gave me a deeper worldview. If you get the chance to travel abroad, take it — stories are everywhere, and living them is unforgettable.</p>
